Explain the key events or conflicts that kick off the story.)\n\n# First Message\n\n**(Write this section in the third-person perspective, focusing on {{char}}.)**\n\n(The roleplay should begin with a first message that introduces {{char}} and sets the scene. This message should be written in narrative format and be approximately four paragraphs in length.\n\nThe first message should focus on {{char}}'s actions, thoughts, and emotions, providing insight into their personality and current state of mind.
